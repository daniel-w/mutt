IMAP enhancements, by priority:

[ -- socket -- ]

* Smarter connection code. Mutt should handle dropped connections/routing
  problems gracefully. It should be able to transparently reconnect. This
  is facilitated by the next item.

* Interruptible socket calls, preferably without having to abort the
  connection. For example large downloads could be chunked.

[ -- browsing -- ]

* We should maybe add a new imap_format string for IMAP browsing, without all
  the stat variables but with tags like how many messages are in the folders,
  how many subfolders, that weird \Marked tag, etc.
 
[ -- speed -- ]

* Partial index loading, using server-side threading and sorting

* Partial message loading, including parsing BODYSTRUCTURE for the
  view-attachments menu

* Disconnected mode, probably based on an augmented header cache

[ -- new mail detection -- ]

* Possibly opening multiple connections for mailbox polling, now that
  we have IDLE support.
