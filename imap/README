Mutt's IMAP support is reasonably good, although still a little rough around
the edges. It has been tested with fairly good results against the following
IMAP4rev1 servers:

* UW-IMAP
* Cyrus
* Courier

There are still some caveats:
* Mutt may not always handle dropped connections very well. For this reason
  it does its best to keep connections alive. But if it fails at this, you
  will probably have to leave mutt uncleanly, and may, eg, lose the message
  you had been working all day on. Save your work!
* The browser is kludgy - it is unintuitive, has occasional difficulties
  with namespaces, and doesn't support creating new IMAP folders. Complain
  away, this will probably get heavily rewritten in 1.3.
* I recommend you not get too fancy with multiple open sesions to the same
  IMAP server. It mostly works, but you may lose flags updates etc, and the
  behaviour is heavily dependent on which server you are using.
* under some circumstances, the index view may become corrupted - that is,
  the headers in the index won't match the message you download. This is
  believed to be fixed late in 1.3, but the changes are extensive enough
  that they probably won't be backported.

Please report bugs to mutt-dev@mutt.org and/or brendan@kublai.com. Version,
options, stack-trace and .muttdebug files are a plus. You may also use the
muttbug script to send bugs to the automated bug-tracking system at
bugs.guug.de.
