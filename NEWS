Major changes since 0.91.1
--------------------------

- additional format for $hdr_format
  	%L	displays the total size of all visible messages in a
		limited view
	%<fmt>	displays current time using strftime(fmt)

- additional operators to the pattern matching lanauge:
	~B<pattern>	finds pattern anywhere in the message (more
			efficient than ~h %s | ~b %s
	~z<size>	finds messages of size <size>
			E.g. 
			 ~z<10k #finds messages smaller than 10KB
			 ~z>10k #finds messages larger than 10KB
			 ~z10k  #finds messages exactly 10KB in length
			 

- the $hdr_format variable is renamed to $index_format
  $hdr_format is still accepted for backwards compatibility

- new variable $folder_format to display entries in the 'browser' menu.

- new variable $followup_to to control generation of Mail-Followup-To
  field. You can edit this field and Mutt will not overwrite it.

- new variable $sendmail_wait

  Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the ``sendmail'' process
  to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.

  Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:

  >0      number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing
  0       wait forever for sendmail to finish
  <0      always put sendmail in the background without waiting

  Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child
  process will be put in a temporary file.  If there is some error, you
  will be informed as to where to find the output.

- Variable $sendmail_bounce has been removed. Mutt now passes all
  recipients on the command line for normal sending. 

- new variable $query_command
  Adds support for querying an external database for email addresses.

- The $forward_decode variable has been removed. This has been split into 2
  variables

  $forward_decode - used when $mime_fwd is not set
  $mime_forward_decode - used when $mime_fwd is set

- new variable $wrap_search. This controls whether searches wrap around the
  end of the mailbox.
  
  When set, searches will wrap around the first (or last) message. When
  unset, searches will not wrap


- New command 'reset' to reset variables to their default compile-time
  definitions. When used with special keyword 'all', all variables are
  reset to their default values. When used with the 'set' command and the
  variable name prefixed with '&', this has the same behaviour as the
  'reset' command.

  Eg. 
   reset move
   reset all
   set &move
   set &all

- Function key names used in muttrc need to be enclosed in <>. 
  Function keys can be used in macros also.
  
  Eg. 
   macro index Y *<PageUp>
   bind index <down> next-entry

- You can now delete a message's attachments by pressing 'd' (delete-entry)
  on the attachment in the attachment menu.
  
- You can now color index menu entries using the pattern matching language.
  The 'uncolor' command resets the entry to its default color. The '*'
  token can be used to reset all index entries to their default colors.
  
  Eg.
    color index blue white ~fvikas
    color index red white ~z>100k
    uncolor index ~fvikas
    uncolor index *
    
- mailboxes specified in save-hooks can be %-expanded using $header_format

- the default save mailbox no longer looks at defined `lists'. To get the
  old behaviour, use
    save-hook ~l %B

- optional strings in format strings have been extended to allow for an
  `else' clause.  the new syntax is:
        %?<testchar>?<if-string>&<else-string>?
  or if no `else' clause is desired (backwards compatibility):
        %?<testchar>?<if-string>?

- If new mail is delivered to a folder when Mutt is displaying a limited
  view of the folder, it is added to the limited view only if it satisfies
  the current limit criteria.

- the <Tab> key on the command-line now completes commands and variable
  names. The longest non-ambiguous part is put on the command-line.
  Entering additional text and using <Tab> will perform completion again.
