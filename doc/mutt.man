None.  Mutts have fleas, not bugs.
.SH FLEAS
.PP
Suspend/resume while editing a file with an external editor does not work
under SunOS 4.x if you use the curses lib in /usr/5lib.  It \fIdoes\fP work
with the S-Lang library, however.
.PP
Resizing the screen while using an external pager causes Mutt to go haywire
on some systems.
.PP
suspend/resume does not work under Ultrix.
.PP
The help line for the index menu is not updated if you change the bindings
for one of the functions listed while Mutt is running.
.PP
