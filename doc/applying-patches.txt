When applying patches to mutt, you may encounter strange error
messages spit out by programs like aclocal, autoconf, automake.
This will happen if your machine has a partial build environment
(see devel-notes.txt for a description of what's needed for mutt
development): Mutt has detected changes to some of the "meta source
files" like configure.in and tries to rebuild other files such as
aclocal.m4 or Makefile.in based on these changes; this will fail if
your build environment is not complete.

If you encounter this kind of problem, touching the following files
after applying patches may help:

	Makefile.in
	config.h.in
	configure
	aclocal.m4

After doing so, simply type "make"; the dependencies should take
care of the necessary other re-building (this may quite well include
a re-running of ./configure).
