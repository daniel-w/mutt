.SH NAME
.PP
dotlock \- Lock mail spool files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B @libdir@/dotlock 
[-t|-f|-u] [-p] [-r \fIretries\fP] \fIfile\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dotlock
implements the traditional mail spool file locking method:
To lock \fIfile\fP, a file named \fIfile\fP.lock is
created. The program operates with group mail privileges
if necessary.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.IP "-t"
Just try.
.B dotlock
won't actually lock a file, but inform the invoking
process if it's at all possible to lock \fIfile\fP.
.IP "-f"
Force the lock.  If another process holds a lock on
\fIfile\fP longer than a certain amount of time, 
.B dotlock
will break that lock by removing the lockfile.
.IP "-u"
Unlock.
.B dotlock 
will remove \fIfile\fP.lock.
.IP "-p"
Use privileges.  If given this option, 
.B dotlock
will operate with group mail privileges when creating and
deleting lock files.
.IP "-r \fIretries\fP"
This command line option tells 
.B dotlock 
to try locking
\fIretries\fP times before giving up or (if invoked with
the 
.B -f
command line option) break a lock.  The default value is 5.
.B dotlock
waits one second between successive locking attempts.  
.SH FILES
.PP
.IP "\fIfile\fP.lock"
The lock file 
.B dotlock
generates.
.SH SEE ALSO
.PP
.BR fcntl (2),
.BR flock (2),
.BR lockfile (1),
.BR mutt (1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
.B dotlock
gives all diagnostics in its return values:
.TP
.B "0 \- DL_EX_OK"
The program was successful.
.TP 
.B "1 \- DL_EX_ERROR"
An unspecified error such as bad command line parameters,
lack of system memory and the like has occured.
.TP 
.B "3 \- DL_EX_EXIST"
The 
user wants to lock a file which has been locked by
another process already.  If 
.B dotlock
is invoked with the
.B -f 
command line option, 
.B dotlock
won't generate this error, but break other processes'
locks.
.TP 
.B "4 \- DL_EX_NEED_RPIVS"
This return value only occurs if 
.B dotlock 
has been invoked
with the 
.B -t
command line option.  It means that
.B dotlock
will have to use its group mail privileges to lock
\fIfile\fP.
.TP
.B "5 \- DL_EX_IMPOSSIBLE"
This return value only occurs if
.B dotlock
has been invoked with the
.B -t
command line option.  It means that
.B dotlock 
is unable to lock \fIfile\fP even with group mail
privileges.
.SH BUGS
.PP
While
.B dotlock
tries to avoid abuse by checking \fIfile\fP's permissions
before locking or unlocking it, there is a race condition
between this check and the actual locking process.  This
means that
.B dotlock
can be used to lock or unlock other folks' mail spool
files under certain circumstances.
.PP
For details, see the comments in dotlock.c.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
.B dotlock
is part of the Mutt mail user agent package.  It has been
created to avoid running mutt with group mail privileges.
