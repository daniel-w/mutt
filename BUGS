			KNOWN BUGS



- In the "compose" menu: attach a file, modify it from
  another terminal, then send the message; Mutt won't
  recompute the transfer encoding.

  This needs to be fixed _without_ overwriting user-set
  transfer encodings.

- In the "compose" menu tag a few attachments, and pipe
  them to "less"; there's no way to convince Mutt to pipe
  them as a single file instead of doing that one by one
  (the "attach_split" and "attach_sep" has disappeared).

- In the "attachment" menu, assume this:

	1 [text/plain, 7bit, 1.1K]           <no description>
	2 [message/rfc822, 7bit, 6.1K]       A test message
	3 [text/plain, 7bit, 0.1K]           |-><no description>
	4 [message/rfc822, base64, 2.5K]     |-><no description>
	5 [message/rfc822, base64, 2.7K]     `-><no description>

  (please note the "message/rfc822" attachments encoded as
  Base64; that's illegal, but Sun's Mailtool sends that
  kind of messages); then go to, say, attachment "4",
  delete it, and go to the main menu; you won't be able to
  quit the mailbox (ok, 'x' works, but 'q' doesn't).

  The problem here lies in the fact that mutt uses mailbox
  handling functions to access message/rfc822 type
  attachments.  We'd need to perform an additional
  decoding step before using these functions to fix this
  bug.

- In maildir folders, the cursor will jump to an
  unpredictible message when new mail arrives.

- When accessing maildir folders with two mutts in
  parallel, messages which have been marked read (and thus
  moved to the cur/ subdirectory) by one of the mutts
  can't be read from the other one.

- set mime_forward. Forward any mesage. The compose menu
  will show the description as "Forwarded message from
  ...." which is fine. Pressing 'd' to edit the
  description brings up the above string for editing.

  Now hit Enter on the message/rfc822 attachment to view
  it. Quit out of the pager.

  The description field has now changed to the Subject: of
  the forwarded message. Pressing 'd' still brings up the
  'Forwarded message from....' string.
