README for mutt-1.5
===================

When updating mutt from an earlier release or from CVS, please make sure
to read the compatbility notes in ``UPDATING''.

If you got the mutt source code from the public CVS repository (CVS
root: :pserver:anonymous@cvs.mutt.org:/home/roessler/cvs, password
anonymous), please read doc/devel-notes.txt to make sure that you
have a complete development environment.

NOTE: The CVS repository now resides on a machine which is different
from ftp.mutt.org.  Anonymous CVS from ftp.mutt.org does not work
any more.

Installation instructions are detailed in ``INSTALL''.

The user manual is in doc/manual.txt.  A list of major changes since
the last public version can be found under NEWS.

PGP users should read doc/PGP-Notes.txt.

Those who upgrade from a version of mutt prior to 1.1 should read
the README.UPGRADE file.

Before you start hacking on mutt, read doc/devel-notes.txt.  Before
applying patches to mutt, read doc/applying-patches.txt.  Please,
read these files, as they will save you from asking FAQs.
