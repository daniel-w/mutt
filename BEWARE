MUTT HACKERS BEWARE

A word of warning about string comparisons: Since mutt may run in a
huge variety of locales, case-insensitive string comparisons and
case conversions may be dangerous.  For instance, in iso-8859-9,
tolower('I') is DIFFERENT from 'i' - it's indeed the Turkish dotless
lowercase i.

For this reason, always use the ascii_* functions defined in ascii.h
and implemented in ascii.c when comparing or handling strings which
are defined as us-ascii.  This concerns lots of text-based
protocols, message header tags, character set names, domain names,
e-mail addresses, etc.
